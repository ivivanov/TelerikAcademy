This document describes the team work assignment for Telerik Academy students studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Project Description
Design and implement an object-oriented application by choice. It could be a simple game (e.g. Minesweeper, Tetris, Xonix or other), component library (windows, buttons, text boxes, menus, etc.), business application (e.g. car store, auction, movie rental, bug tracker, knowledge management system, e-library, text editor), or any other. You are absolutely free to choose the topic of your work.
General Requirements
Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:
•  At least 3 interfaces (with one or more implementations)
•	At least 10 classes (implementing the application logic)
•	At least 1 abstract class (with inheritors)
•	At least 1 exception class (with usage in your code)
•	At least 1 structure
•	At least 1 enumeration
•	At least 2 events (with subscribers)
•	At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, Iterator, …)
You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.
Additional Requirements
•	Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
•	Obligatory use Team Foundation Server (TFS) to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use http://tfs.visualstudio.com or http://codeplex.com). SVN or Git are not allowed. Use TFS.
•	Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).
Optional Requirements
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
•	Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
•	Constants, generic types, indexers, operators
•	Lambda expressions and LINQ
•	Implementation of IEnumerable<T>, ICloneable, ToString() override
•	Namespaces (if your classes are too much)
Non-Required Work
•	User interface (UI) is not required. You do not need to provide graphical user interface (GUI) or web or mobile UI. You may implement the UI in the console or do not have UI at all. Of course, if you are capable to build WPF or Web-based UI, you are free to do it but beware: it takes time (more than you expect)!
•	Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with TFS. 
Deliverables
Put the following in a ZIP archive and submit it (each team member submits the same file):
•	The complete source code.
•	Brief documentation of your project (2-3 pages). It should provide the following information (in brief):
o	Team name and list of team members
o	Project purpose – what problem do you solve?
o	Class diagram of your types
o	The URL of your TFS repository
o	Any other information (optionally)
•	Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense.
Public Project Defense
Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work in from of the other students and trainers. You will have only 5 minutes for the following:
•	Demonstrate the application (very shortly).
•	Show the class diagram (just a glance).
•	Show the source code in the TFS web-based source code browser.
•	Show the commits logs to confirm that team member have contributed.
•	Optionally you might prepare a PowerPoint presentation (3-4 slides).
Please be strict in timing! Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time. You have 5 minutes, no more.
Give Feedback about Your Teammates
You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so take it seriously and be honest.
